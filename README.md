# Guzzle-Practice
Playing around with guzzle and psr7 interfaces. Added a C program to start scripts.

To start the program run ./guzzle [option]

In order to see the list of available options use ./guzzle --help

The bin can be recompiled from start_script sourcecode.

Don't forget to run composer install to get all dependencies !!
