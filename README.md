# Guzzle-Practice
Playing around with guzzle and psr7 interfaces. Added a C program to start scripts.

To start the program run ./guzzle [option]

If you want to start using php bin then feel free to, with : php index.php [options]

In order to see the list of available options use ./guzzle --help or php index.php --help

The bin can be recompiled from start_script.c sourcecode.

Don't forget to run composer install to get all dependencies !!
